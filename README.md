# graphingWebsite

## When using the API in jupyter labs, open jupyter lab with: jupyter lab --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1e10

## Tutorials I followed while creating this:
* Pyscript tutorial (playlist): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpdmBGJ6ELUJ2ujkBcMQ3n0D2J2exAVTs
* How to use public API tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HfSFdPEFRg

## Description:
* Create a website that responds to files (.csv) being uploaded and automatically make a graph from certain perameters
* Once I can do this, I will then get the website to make a graph by calling an api



## TO-DO:
* Learn pyscript to import a csv to the website which will then make a graph (can later add more features for customizability such as choosing which plot and which columns to use for graphing)
* Obtain a .csv file using an api to generate the graph (same customizable features mentioned in the previous point can be added; also add the option to download the .csv file)
* Learn docker
